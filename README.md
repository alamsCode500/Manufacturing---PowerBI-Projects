End-to-End Business Intelligence & Advanced DAX Project

# 👤 Author

Name: Tauseef Alam

Tool: Microsoft Power BI

# 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing manufacturing operations and workforce performance using Microsoft Power BI.
It integrates production data with employee performance data to uncover cost drivers, efficiency gaps, productivity trends, and workforce impact on manufacturing outcomes.

The project demonstrates real-world BI skills, including data cleaning, data modeling, advanced DAX, forecasting, anomaly detection, and executive-level dashboards.

# 🎯 Business Objectives

* Identify operational inefficiencies in manufacturing

* Analyze production cost drivers and cost efficiency

* Evaluate employee performance, salary, and tenure trends

* Understand country-wise production and workforce distribution

* Forecast future production demand and cost trends

* Detect production anomalies and risk areas

# 📂 Datasets Used

Dataset --	Description

ManufacturingDataset1.xlsx --	Production data: product, cost, quantity, warehouse, country

ManufacturingDataset2.xlsx --	Employee data: department, salary, performance, training

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Microsoft Power BI

* Power Query – Data cleaning & transformation

* DAX – Measures, calculated columns, forecasting

* Data Modeling – Relationships, Date Table

* Advanced Analytics – Moving averages, anomaly detection

# 🔄 Data Preparation & Modeling

# Data Cleaning

Production Data

* Removed duplicate ProductIDs

* Replaced missing production costs with averages

* Removed records with zero quantity

* Standardized dates and country names

Employee Data

* Removed duplicate EmployeeIDs

* Cleaned invalid department values

* Normalized hire dates

* Structured unclean training records

* Ensured referential integrity via ProductID

Data Modeling

* Created Primary–Foreign Key relationship using ProductID

* Built a Date Table for time intelligence

* Added calculated columns:

  * Employee Tenure

  * Product Category

# 📐 Key DAX Measures

* Average Production Cost

* Cost Per Unit

* Average Salary

* Average Performance Rating

* Total Quantity Produced

* Predicted Demand (3-Month Moving Average)

* Forecasted Production Cost

# 📊 Dashboard & Analysis Highlights

# Core Business Questions Answered

* Which product categories are most expensive to produce?

* Which departments have highest employee count and performance?

* Which countries dominate production and workforce presence?

* Is there a correlation between salary and performance?

* How does production trend seasonally?

* Which warehouses are most utilized?

* Where do production anomalies and cost spikes occur?

* How will future demand and costs behave?

# 🔍 Key Insights

* Machinery products are the most cost-efficient (lowest cost per unit)

* Textiles show higher cost per unit → optimization opportunity

* Sales department has the largest workforce

* USA has the highest employee count; China leads in production

* Salaries peak mid-year (July) due to appraisal cycles

* Moderate positive correlation between salary and performance

* Clear seasonal production patterns across product types

* Identified production anomalies indicating operational risks

* Forecasting shows gradual increase in production costs

# 📈 Advanced Analytics

* Demand Forecasting using 3-Month Moving Average

* Production Cost Forecasting for next quarter

* Anomaly Detection using statistical deviation analysis

* Product Lifecycle Analysis (Introduction → Growth stages)

# 💼 Business Value

* Enables data-driven manufacturing decisions

* Helps identify cost optimization opportunities

* Supports workforce planning and performance management

* Improves capacity planning and inventory strategy

* Assists leadership with predictive insights

# 🚀 Challenges & Learnings

# Challenges

* Cleaning inconsistent department data

* Handling ambiguous date relationships in DAX

* Designing dashboards without visual clutter

* Implementing forecasting without external ML tools

# Learnings

* Strong hands-on experience with Power Query

* Advanced DAX problem-solving

* Practical data modeling best practices

* Improved business storytelling using dashboards
